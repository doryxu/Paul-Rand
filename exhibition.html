      <center><h3>Advance Guard of Advertising Artists</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center"><em>Katharine Kuh Gallery<br>October, 1941</em></p>
      <img src="photo/download.jpg" height=300px>
      <p>A very good to near-fine exhibition catalogue in saddle-stitched printed wrappers with deckled edge on shortened frontis. Light wear to spine and tiny chip to one corner. Catalogue design by Gyorgy Kepes. An exceptionally rare and significant title.<br><br>

      The ADVANCE GUARD Show at the Katharine Kuh Gallery was the first time Paul Rand’s work was exhibited in a gallery setting. In Heller’s Paul Rand monograph, the location of the Gallery is incorrectly listed as New York City (page 242).<br><br>

      8.5 x 11 softcover catalogue with 28 pages and 20 examples of advertising art printed on various paper stocks. Souvenir exhibition catalog with complete list of works shown, short biographies and an introductory essay by Miss Kuh. Katherine Kuh was Curator of the Gallery of Art interpretation and Associate Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as the Editor of the Institute’s quarterly publication, The Bulletin.<br><br>

      This exhibition marked the first signs of the assimilation of the European Avant-Garde into mainstream American Advertising. For the first time Bauhaus refugees Bayer and Moholy-Nagy as well as Kepes and Sutnar were placed on the same level as the homegrown heroes Beall, Rand, Kauffer and Barr. Of particular interest is the Chicago location of the exhibit — no doubt instigated by Kepes and Moholy at the fledgling Institute of Design (New Bauhaus).<br><br>

      Kepes catalog design is an amazing integration of the European avant-garde spirit with the no-nonsense midwestern sensibility: the fine press history of Chicago’s Printers Row is referenced by the deckled edge and the repetitous eyeball engavings on the catalog cover; but European functionalism orders the interior, with Tschichold’s New Typography very much in evidence.</p></center>

      <center><h3>The Graphic Art of Paul Rand</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center"><em>IBM Gallery<br>May 18 – June 20, 1970</em></p>
        <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FZyr1K1Oc7c/T7Qx4anqoAI/AAAAAAAABMY/jmiThHpXVIU/s1600/the-graphic-art-of-paul-rand-1970.jpg"height=300px>
        <p>IBM is pleased to present an exhibition of the work of Paul Rand, one of the most innovative and influential designers of the twentieth century. Called by Print magazine “The first American designer to apply the Bauhaus values of simplicity and abstraction both consistently and effectively,” he is considered one of the pioneers of the “look” of contemporary graphic design. In the process, he has helped redefine the role of the art director from that of a middle-man, who put together the work of others (writer, illustrator, letterer, and typographer) to that of a de-signer of a total concept, concerned with both form and content. In a career covering more than thirty-five years, he has won international recognition for his designs for advertisements, books, posters, packaging, trademarks, and for corpo-rate design programs, as well as for his abilities as an illustrator, writer and teacher.<br><br>

        The nature and quality of his work is perhaps best characterized by Gibson A. Danes, Dean of the School of Art and Architecture at Yale University when Rand taught there. “At a moment when we are surfeited with the mundane and the mediocre,” he has written, “Paul Rand’s precise, elegant and often witty visual statements are like a spring breeze. He can make the ordinary, extraordinary; the mundane becomes magical. All of this happens with a clarity and intuitive logic that makes the compact solution seem inevitable because it is right. Perhaps the real touchstone of his imaginative power is his rigorous awareness of quality. Whatever he does somehow seems to be a qualitative improvement upon what was there before.”<br><br>

        Born in New York City, Rand studied at Pratt Institute, Parsons School of Design, and at the Art Students League under George Grosz. At the age of twenty-three, he became art director of Esquire/Apparel Arts and later of the Weintraub Advertising Agency. He has taught at Pratt Institute and Cooper Union, and from 1956 to 1969 was professor of graphic design at Yale University. For many years he has been a consultant to several major corporations, among them IBM.<br><br>

        Paul Rand’s achievements have been recognized in many ways. In 1966 he received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. He received a citation from the Philadelphia College of Art in 1962, and was made an honorary professor of Tama University, Tokyo in 1958. In 1959 the book, “Paul Rand,” by Yusaku Kamekura, was published by Zokeisha Publications, Tokyo, and Alfred A. Knopf, New York.<br><br>

        Rand’s book, “Thoughts on Design,” which was published in 1947, is being issued both here and abroad in revised form as a paperback this year. He is also the author of “The Trademarks of Paul Rand” and “Design and the Play Instinct,” as well as numerous papers on design, advertising and typography, and has illustrated a series of child-dren’s books published by Harcourt, Brace & World.<br><br>

        Mr. Rand is a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale, The Industrial Designers Society of America, The New York Art Directors Club, The Society of Typographic Arts, and The Typophiles. He is a past member of the Fulbright Scholarship Jury, and an adviser on art eduacnation to the Philadelphia College of Art and The Museum School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.<br><br>

      <center><h3>Chico State University: Paul Rand Retrospective</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center"><em>CSU, Chico’s Albert E. Warrens Reception Center<br>April 2 – 25, 2003</em></p>
      <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRN85-6Y8UyiLIpyoJryDWj_YxBNvdhpSameWKmAOjYHbSIopOK"height=300px>
      <p>Thanks to the efforts of Communication Design faculty Barbara Sudick and Frank Armstrong, California State University, Chico will pay tribute next month to the late Paul Rand, the professors’ former teacher and world-renowned graphic designer.<br><br>

      Rand, who died in 1996 at the age of 82, was one of the pioneers of American graphic design. In a field with little name recognition, Rand nevertheless created symbols almost universally recognized: the familiar corporate logos for companies such as IBM, UPS, Westinghouse, NeXt, and Enron.<br><br>

      Steeped in European Modernism and equally adept at whimsy and simplicity, Rand was terrifically influential as a designer, illustrator, author, and teacher. “He was the American graphic designer,” said Sudick, a graduate student of Rand’s at Yale University.<br><br>

      Sudick and her husband, communication design instructor Frank Armstrong, both attended classes with Rand and have written on Rand’s importance in American graphic design.</p></center>

      <center><h3>Everything Is Design: The Work of Paul Rand</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center"><em>Museum of the City of New York (MCNY)<br>February 25 – October 13, 2015</em></p>
      <img src="photo/press3.jpg" height=300px>
      <p>Everything Is Design: The Work of Paul Rand features more than 150 advertisements, posters, corporate brochures, and books by this master of American design.<br><br>

      It was Rand who most creatively brought European avant-garde art movements such as Cubism and Constructivism to graphic design in the United States. His philosophy, as expressed in his work and writings, including the recently republished 1947 Thoughts on Design, argued that visual language should integrate form and function. Born in Brooklyn in humble circumstances, Rand (1914-1996) launched his career in the 1930s with magazine cover design and, starting in the early 1940s, he worked as an art director on Madison Avenue, where he helped revolutionize the advertising profession.<br><br>

      He later served as design consultant to leading corporations like IBM, ABC, UPS, and Steve Jobs’s NeXT, for whom he conceived comprehensive visual communications systems, ranging from packaging to building signage, all grounded in recognizable logos, many of which are still in use today. Rand’s influence was extended by students he taught at Yale University. His visually stimulating, yet problem-solving, approach to graphic design attracted devoted admirers during his own lifetime and he remains influential today.</p></center>
