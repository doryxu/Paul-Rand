    <h3 style="text-align:center">Black in the Visual Arts</h3>

    <p>In these lines the French poet, Rimbaud, uses the word black to describe and symbolize carnality, death, and decay. This traditional association of the color black with death and sin is long standing and has led to the widespread conviction in both art and lay circles that black is depressing and sinister and therefore, if possible, must be avoided. As a result, the power and usefulness of black has been limited or misunderstood. During this century many individual artists, architects, and designers have rebelled against the conventional use and misuse of black. However, the prejudices against this color are still sufficiently strong to require a discussion of the properties of black and a vigorous defense of its many virtues.<br><br>

    'In nature, black and its companion color white are dramatically juxtaposed in the contrast between day and night. The monotony of uninterrupted darkness or light would be intolerable. Black in the trunks of trees subtly sets off the brilliance of green or autumn-colored leaves. Throughout nature we find the equivalent of black and white in shadow and light—there are caves and canyons as well as fields and meadows. Man as a rule does the least violence to nature when he uses either natural materials, such as stone or wood, or black and white for the objects he places out of doors. Natural colors are integrated, white participates by reflecting its environmental color, and black modestly provides perfect background for the riotous nature colors. Certainly those people who observed with pleasure the old-fashioned black steam engine wind its way agreeably through green fields and forests, have watched with a kind of horror the orange or blue streamliner that now streaks garishly across the countryside.<br><br>

    The decidedly ambivalent nature of black has been understood in daily use. In the east and southwest of the United States and in Europe black is by far the most popular color for pleasure vehicles, but it is also the color of the hearse. In clothes black is the color of tragedy, mourning. At the same time it is the color of elegance and of sensuous enjoyment in the conventionally “sexy” black lingerie.<br><br>

    If we look further into the psychological significance of black, it is linked with mystery, with death which is unknowable, with night which is full of hidden things—of fear and magic.<br><br>

    In some countries black or near-black has been employed extensively in architecture and interior design, The color pattern of the Japanese house is based on the contrasting use of dark and light materials. Dark wood often delineates the basic structure of the house and separates it aesthetically from the light colored partition walls (fusuma) and floor mats (tatami).<br><br>

    Black in the Visual ArtsZoom
    The first of my illustrations (A) shows a building designed by Mies van der Rohe in which black is a crucial aesthetic factor. The structural members of this steel building are exposed and painted black. The effect of this is manifold: the structure is clearly defined, it is placed in dramatic contrast to the pale non-bearing brick walls, the bulk of its members is reduced making them appear light and delicate, great elegance is achieved without the use of expensive materials or decoration, and the restraint and restfulness of black makes the building a welcome oasis in the chaotic heart of the city.<br><br>

    It is, of course, understood that like any color the value of black depends upon the manner in which it is used. Black will be lugubrious or bright and elegant depending on its context and form. Despite the successful use of black in Japan and in modern buildings and interiors there are still many people who deny black categorically.<br><br>

    A doctor writing on the use of color in interiors issues a grim warning against black: “This is the most dismal of all colors—it expresses all that is opposite to white.”[2] Among these opposites he lists the grave, sin, and crime.<br><br>

    This type of blanket denunciation of a color completely ignores the relative nature of any color or form. Eisenstein writing about the film says: “Even within the limitations of a color-range of black and white … one of these tones not only evades being given a single ‘value’ as an absolute image, but can even assume absolutely contradictory meanings, dependent only upon the general system of imagery that has been decided upon for the particular film.” [3] He goes on to illustrate this important point by the reversal of the role of black in relation to white in the two films Old and New and Alexander Nevsky. In the former, black signified things reactionary, outdated, and criminal, while white denoted happiness, life, and progress; whereas in Alexander Nevsky white was the color of cruelty, oppression, and death, and black, identified with the Russian warriors, represented heroism and patriotism. Eisenstein’s response to the surprise and protest of the critics at this reversal of traditional symbolism is to cite Moby Dick’s famous white whale—the reader will recall that the leprous, livid whiteness of this whale symbolized the world’s monstrous and baffling evil.<br><br>

    During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, black (with some notable exceptions) was treated as a linear element or was associated with modeling and chiaroscuro. Kahnweiler in The Rise of Cubism says: “Since it was the mission of color to create the form as chiaroscuro, or light that had become perceivable, there was no possibility of rendering local color or color itself.”[4] Although Kahnweiler is referring to color in general, this statement applies very forcibly to black. In the twentieth century the possibilities of rendering color as a thing in itself and not primarily as a description of three dimensionality or “objectivated light,” have been rediscovered and exploited. Coincident with this trend, black has come into its own as a positive “plastic” value.<br><br>

    Among the many artists who have used black as a vital element in their work are Rouault, Braque, Miro, Leger, Arp, and Picasso. Beardsley, Masereel, and Posada, for example, have used it almost exclusively.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Posters</h3>
    <p>
    	The essence of the “art of the poster” is not a matter of literal content nor technique but one of creating visual ideas appropriate to the medium.<br><br>

  	Countless so-called posters are not in fact posters at all- they are merely enlarged illustrations which ignore the fundamental functional considerations of size, distant viewing, and speed of the viewer which should be the determinant of poster design. By demanding that the poster be simple, bold, and striking these factors distinguish the poster unequivocally from the illustration which, like a miniature or easel painting, is intended for close and leisurely inspection and can therefore be complex and subtle. Unfortunately where it has been recognized that a poster must be immediately and potently attractive this has been widely interpreted to mean a blow up of a “pretty girl” or the rendering of a fantastically elongated motor car.<br><br>

  	It has been forgotten that color and design are the basic elements of attraction in the same sense that flags, pennants, flowers, bright fabrics, and heraldic devices are the age old means of dramatization and advertisement. Clearly the appeal of these purely plastic elements cannot be calculated by surveys, polls, and pulse takers; therefore in this age of reverence for statistics it is apt to be ignored or lightly dismissed. Hence, the poster becomes formulized into the above mentioned pretty girl plus product or oversized product plus label.<br><br>

  	Consequently to see one poster is to see all, and the prime and crucial factor in poster design is flouted - i.e. sensory appeal.<br><br>

  	A good poster is, however, only half the battle for the best poster if badly displayed cannot only be revitalized but can actually become a visual irritation if it interrupts architectural forms or obtrudes rudely into the landscape. It is unnecessary to remind the reader of the r avages done to city and countryside by the wanton plastering of post ers on every available space. But apparently it is necessary to remind the advertiser who defeats his own purpose by rendering his advertising obnoxious rather than pleasurable.<br><br>

  	A poster must attract as quickly and boldly as a banner and excite sensations of pleasure and interest in the observer.
  	The placing of the poster and its design should be interdependent. The American poster producer’s obsession with size, i.e. 24 sheet, not only leads to monotony but makes the post er difficult to place. The virtues of the small post er are overlooked and 24 sheet billboards are post ed in alleyways or along sidewalks where the small size poster is obviously more practicable. Likewise the flexibility of the small poster is not appreciated, for instance it can be shown not only single but repeated within larger frames - a device widely and effectively used in Europe and one which by creating a repetitive pattern, can render even a mediocre poster exciting. Furthermore the small poster being ideally suited for peripatetic inspection, can be displayed with great impact if instead of being haphazardly pasted on walls it is exhibited within an appropriate architectural framework - for example the cylindrical kiosk. This kiosk which is found all over Europe is worth special mention because it can combine competing posters. Its circular form permits each poster to be viewed in comparative isolation and, because it is not merely an effective sidewalk display device, it makes a positive contribution to the gayety and architectural beauty of the urban scene.<br><br>

  	In America isolated efforts have been made to correlate the poster with its setting as for instance in subway advertising where size and spacing of posters is controlled. If these efforts multiply, and the quality of poster design improves, outdoor advertising could easily become a pleasure to the community as well as an effective advertising medium.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Gene & Helen Federico</h3>
    <p>If this were being written for a popular magazine the fact that Gene and Helen Federico are a husband and wife team of artists would undoubtedly be of tremendous interest, however for the readers of GRAPHIS this fact is not of primary importance. The outstanding characteristic of the Federicos is that these two graphic artists operate successfully and maintain their artistic integrity in a world which is by and large unsympathetic to artists in general and to the problems involved in their work. For the most part the commercial art world is unfortunately willing to “sell” the products it promotes at any artistic price, paying no heed to its cultural obligations and complacently destroying whatever self-respect it might possess. The field of advertising has become addicted to such drugs as surveys, consumer questionnaires, and reports, thus substituting the wishful manipulation of statistics for creative endeavour. Where so much emphasis is placed on pat phrases and stereotyped formulas an atmosphere which makes graphic artists far from happy is necessarily produced, and it is superfluous to add that the artist’s lot becomes increasingly frustrating in proportion to his adventurousness and originality. After this brief but lugubrious description of the advertising ambiance, the reader will realize that graphic artists like Gene and Helen Federico deserve much credit for having the courage and stamina to meet and overcome the resistance not only of conservative and culturally irresponsible clients but also that within their own field. In this context the talented work of the two Federicos takes on a deeper significance even than that which it earns plastically.<br><br>

    It is perhaps not amiss in these troubled and troublesome times to note the sociological as well as the cultural contributions of sincere, gifted young artists like the Federicos. They not only seek and affirm a higher standard in the all-important communicative arts but they in their role of artists with integrity, are to be numbered among that small but potent minority who strive in an age of increasing “conformism” and mass produced mediocrity to live and create as individuals, who seek inspiration rather than security in tradition, and who in their work testify to their belief in the creative vitality of the human being.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Ideas About Ideas</h3>
    <p>In the June issue, ID inaugurated a series of “case histories” of graphic designs: Lester Beall’s integrated design program for the Torrington Manufacturing Company was accompanied by his comments on the layout he prepared, offering insight into the approach of a designer working in this important area of designing for industry. In this installment, Paul Rand explains how and why the examples of his work were organized and laid out as we see them on these eight pages. <br><br>

    Any theory of mine on “inspiration” is offered with reservations, because creativity is almost as mysterious to the artist himself as to the layman. However, I do believe that for the most part inspiration comes from rather unromantic and often unexpected sources.<br><br>

    The artist is by necessity a collector; he accumulates things with the same ardor and curiosity that a boy stuffs his pockets. He borrows from the sea and from the scrap heap; he takes snapshots, makes mental notes, and records impressions on tablecloths and newspaper — why one particular thing and not another, he may not know at the time, but he is omniverous. He has a taste for children’s wall scrawlings as appreciative as that for pre-historic cave painting. Wildly heterogenous as his inspirational source material appears, there is a common denominator, and that is the satisfaction of his constant search for new forms; he takes note of what jolts him into visual and emotional awareness. Without this harvest of visual experience, he would be unable to cope with the multitude of problems that confront him in his work.<br><br>

    Like any designer, when I have extracted from a mass of complex material the how, the why, the when and the where, I may find there (or in the unconscious storehouse) one or more symbols to convey the significant idea. These must be used suggestively, to engage the imagination. Contrast is one of the guiding principles — not only a contrast of symbols, as in the Olivetti ad (previous page), but the contrast in size, color, technique, in a photograph juxtaposed with a line drawing. The effect of startling simultaneity, with two unrelated objects integrated in space, creates a kind of visual test, inviting the spectator to observe and decipher it for himself. Besides the strong contrast in the Disney ad at the left, there is an attracting, rhythmic repetition in the squares and rectangles. This sense of continuity underlies the layout of the whole spread, with the black square from the Disney hat repeated to unite a group of small, unrelated pictures. Four squares in turn make a larger one, clearly organizing the page.<br><br>

    There is a definite emotional force generated by the repetition of words or pictures, and there are endless graphic possibilities here. Rhythmic repetition is apparent in all the examples on this spread: in the stencil, in the book jacket where the same typography is used more freely, for “El Producto” to suggest that cigars come from abroad; and it supplies the basic forms for the fabric design.<br><br>

    Bleed pages (right) should be used only when they contribute to the total visual effect, when they help to clarify the message, and when they convey the provocative quality of something partly seen. The full page single ads in this article use the bleed simply as an extension of a white or black background ; in the fabric, the bleed gives the feeling of the continuity of a bolt of cloth. A rhythm is also created by the alternating bleed pages in the total layout. Since we are in the habit of reading from the left, I started this article with text on the left rather than on the conventional right side. This, I feel, helps the article begin as a spread and not as a single page. I used a full-page photograph to create a visual conclusion to the story.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center">The Art of the Package</h3>
    <p>This statement was made some years ago by a specialist in package design. Today any grocer or druggist’s shelf is testimony to the fervent enthusiasm with which such views have been endorsed.<br><br>

    Technical advance in the field of packaging has been impressive indeed: the one-piece “flip-top,” the push-button container, the shining array of new plastics with ingenious closures, the cleverly contrived shapes that stack, fit refrigerators or pockets, collapse, expand, etc. But does all this make a package? No! There is more to a package than convenience; it has to be looked at. How many flip-top cigarette packs or regular cigarette packs, for that matter, afford any pleasure to the eye? How consistently are we blinded by the dazzling display of vulgarity eagerly provided by most push-button cans, cereal boxes, soaps, bread wrappers, etc? Many, admittedly, are cleverly packaged. Technologically, scientifically and hygienically, packages of today are practical, but are they beautiful?<br><br>

    Functionalism does not preclude beauty, but it does not guarantee it either.<br><br>

    <strong>OUTSHOUT THE COMPETITION!</strong><br>
    Indifference to aesthetic factors and the espousal of vulgarity probably derive mainly from the advertiser’s single-minded preoccupation with having his product noticed and then quickly identified. In the frantic hope of “standing out,” he tries to outshout, outcolor, and outglitter his competitor.<br><br>

    He approves gaudy color schemes, oversized or misshapen lettering embellished with outlines, double or triple shadows, and other exhibitionistic devices of design. Good surface design is a complex matter. It does not automatically result from the felicitous discovery of new materials, ingenious closures or novel gimmicks, anymore than it derives from blatant display. “Surface design” should in no way imply superficiality, for it is this which often gives the designer the opportunity to enrich and personalize and articulate an otherwise bare and anonymous shape. Such a goal can be arrived at through a design as simple as the Chanel label or one more complicated like the Guinness label.<br><br>

    The obsession with functional shapes and new materials is a dangerous limitation even for the conscientious designer blessed with a sensitive client. It tends to promote a misconception of simplicity, translating this admirable quality into bareness or rendering it self-conscious to the point of vapidity. This tendency is pronounced in a number of the cigarette packs which have recently invaded the market.<br><br>

    It is not my intention to promote a movement towards fancy or complicated package design, but rather to stress the point that preoccupation with anyone element of a visual object at the expense of others is impoverishing, and poverty in the literal sense is not a virtue of design. It is my contention that all the formal elements which comprise a package must be treated with understanding, with love, and with an equal amount of dignity.<br><br>

    <strong>DIGNITY, RESPECT AND GUIDES</strong><br>
    Understanding means, among many things, that the designer must appreciate the difference between metal and plastic, glass and pottery, or paper and foil in terms of their graphic implications. “Dignity,” like understanding, is a general term, a principle of action. It does not mean that a product name should be small when a large one would be more effective or that ornaments should or shouldn’t be used. It means that a sense of dignity and the respect for work which accompanies it are indispensable guides to the designer in determining such formal problems of when, where and how. If a designer treats his work with love, he will, for instance, recognize the anecdotal or associative aspects of packages. He will know that buyers have visual memories and fondness for the familiar. He will then be better able to decide in the redesign of an old package which elements should be retained, discarded, altered or refined. He will be aware of the nostalgic appeal of old cigar boxes, Pears Soap wrappers, Victor’s barking dog and will wonder about the wisdom of streamlining the ‘White Rock girl.<br><br>

    Although it is only possible to deal in generalities when it comes to a description of artistic principles, it is useful to show them in action, to make them more concrete by example. I hope, therefore, the illustrations shown here will demonstrate some of the points I have tried to make.<br><br>

    Chanel packaging is perhaps a classic in its field. Each formal ingredient makes a contribution of itself and for the whole-the color and quality of the paper used, the trademark and how it is placed as well as its size and weight, the type face (traditionally considered more suitable for Mack Trucks) the black border complementing the circular trademark, and finally the shape, size and proportion of the boxes and bottles themselves. The combination of ingredients is indivisable and to remove anyone would destroy the package’s identity and beauty. The Chanel design is an excellent study in visual contrasts: here is black and white, round and straight, big and small, hard and soft.

    <strong>LABEL SHOULD ENRICH SHAPE</strong><br>
    In a recent exhibition of packaging at the Museum of Modern Art, a bottle of Odol mouthwash was prominently displayed, but it could only be identified by those familiar with its unusual shape since the label, ironically, was removed. This; I imagine, was because the bottle looked better without it. The actual label is far from attractive, yet one can conceive of a label design which would not only serve its prime function-product identification but which would enhance the already beautiful form by enriching or emphasizing its shape.<br><br>

    The Chinese jardiniere (Kang Hsi, 1662-1722), although not in the strictest sense a package, poses the same problems that the design of any cylindrical pack age does-namely, working on a rounded surface. It is virtually impossible to imagine this vase without the bands of calligraphy which cover its entire surface, so in harmony with its form is the applied design. True, shape and proportion would remain unchanged, but the enriching exploitation of material, the emphasizing of contour, excitement of pattern and the interest of the message (poem) would unhappily be lost.<br><br>

    At first glance it is difficult to ascertain why the package of tobacco (on page 96) is so attractive. Is it the ornament, color, type, paper, texture or mere nostalgia? Looking analytically we find it is a fine study in contrasts: plain brown paper, white label, ornamental border and simple typography. It is a soft package which contrasts with the brittle ornamentation of its surface design. The package suggests its contents and does so with grace and dignity. Similar qualities characterize the Garnier Elixir wood bottle.<br><br>

    <strong>RESPECT FOR MATERIALS</strong><br>
    The other examples shown, both simple and complex, demonstrate that the package designer’s problem is not essentially one of looking for new materials, but of understanding the importance of the artist’s hand in relation to those materials, whether they be old or new. A good package of yesterday, today, or tomorrow as well, expresses the respect of the artist for his materials in that he neither overwhelms them with meaningless or contrived ornament nor strips them of all interest and excitement out of a kind of engineering fetish. In a good package the designer does not seek to exploit the consumer’s visual memories and attachments by sentimental distortion but to express his objective appreciation of the fact that people do have strong affective reaction to “things.” This appreciation should promote a wider view of the designer’s job-he does not seek merely to convenience the hand nor to please the eye, but he may also, however lightly, touch the emotions and gratify the human spirit.</p>
